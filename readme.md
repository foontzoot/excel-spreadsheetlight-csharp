For teaching how to work with Excel. 

- Some examples use Entity Framework Core
- Most examples use SpreadSheetLight, free Excel library

For ages coders and developers alike believe that when working with Excel that Excel automation is the best way but there are many issues while when working with .xlsx libraries like GemBox, Aspose cells and others solve these problems. 

Problem for those on a shoe-string budget is these libraries are out of reach cost-wise. So this repository I picked one of many free libraries, [SpreadSheetLight](https://spreadsheetlight.com/) to show how to perform common operations for Excel.
